# Contributing to my-PV Home Assistant integration

Thank you for your interest in contributing to my-PV Home Assistant integration! These guidelines will help you make contributions smoothly and effectively.

## How to Contribute

1. **Reporting Issues and Suggesting Features**
   - First, check the existing issues to ensure that your problem or feature request has not already been reported.
   - Create a new issue in the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/EldarKarahasanovic/myPVHomeAssistant/issues) if you find a bug or want to propose a new feature. Please provide as much detail as possible.

2. **Code Contributions**
   - **Fork the Repository**: Click the “Fork” button at the top right of the repository page to create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.
   - **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch in your fork for your contribution. Use a descriptive name for the branch, such as `bugfix/issue-123` or `feature/new-feature`.
     ```bash
     git checkout -b branch-name
     ```
   - **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes locally in your branch. Ensure that your code adheres to the project’s coding standards.
   - **Testing**: Run all tests to ensure that your changes do not break existing functionality. Add new tests if you are implementing new features.
   - **Commit**: Commit your changes with clear, descriptive commit messages. Follow the project’s commit message conventions.
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Description of the commit"
     ```
   - **Push**: Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.
     ```bash
     git push origin branch-name
     ```
   - **Create a Pull Request**: Create a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to our `main` branch. Describe your changes in the PR and link to the relevant issue if applicable.

3. **Code Review**
   - A maintainer will review your Pull Request and may request additional changes. Be open to feedback and ready to make adjustments.
   - Once your Pull Request is approved, it will be merged into the main repository.

## Contribution Guidelines

- **Code Style**: Follow the code style defined in the project. Ensure your code is well-structured and documented.
- **Documentation**: If you add or modify features, update the documentation accordingly.
- **Tests**: All new features and changes must be thoroughly tested. Add new tests if necessary.
- **Issue References**: Reference any issues affected by your changes in your commit messages and Pull Requests.
- **Contributor License Agreement**: By submitting a Pull Request, you agree to our license agreement, which allows us to use your changes in the project.
